# cljsjs/showdown

[](dependency)
```clojure
[cljsjs/trello-client "0.0.1-1"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler.

It does not ship the Trello Client source, so this wil need to be provided through some other means (like a `<script>` include tag)
